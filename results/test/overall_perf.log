Tuttavia, questo comportamento può avere conseguenze negative anche all'interno della famiglia.\n\nIl silenzio può infatti nascondere una serie di problemi, tanto da poter diventare una barriera alla comunicazione. I genitori, ad esempio, possono evitare di condividere i loro problemi finanziari, di salute o di relazioni interpersonali difficili con i propri figli. In questo modo, però, i figli potrebbero non comprendere appieno le difficoltà che la famiglia sta affrontando e sentirsi esclusi.\n\nD'altra parte, il silenzio dei figli può preoccupare molto i genitori e nascondere problemi emotivi, di bullismo o di aiutistica. In questi casi, è importante che la famiglia sia un luogo di sostegno e confronto, dove si possano trovare soluzioni insieme.\n\nLa tecnologia può essere un'opportunità per superare il silenzio familiare, attraverso chat familiari, gruppi Whatsapp e videochiamate per mantenere un contatto costante e sincero.\n\nIn ogni caso, la famiglia dovrebbe essere il porto sicuro di ogni individuo, dove trovare supporto, comprensione e amore in ogni momento della propria vita. Solo mantenendo una comunicazione aperta e costante si può veramente rompere il velo del silenzio ed aiutare chi ne ha bisogno."]

Let’s pretend like we are playing one of these games, where you are the game and I’m the player. Here are some rules and ideas about how the game should work:\n\t1. Remember, you are the game, not the player, understand?   \n\t2. The game setting is a dark dungeon.\n\t3. Each room should have a unique name, displayed at the top of the screen on each turn. \n\t4. Keep close track of what is in player inventory, and what items are in which rooms and where in the room. If the player picks up something it goes into the player inventory and should no longer show up in the room. If the player drops something, it should show up in the room in which it was dropped. If they put an object on a shelf or in some sort of container, it should show up in that place. \n\t5. An object cannot be in two places at the same time, so be careful to keep track of where things are.\n\t6. Remember the player’s inventory, but don’t display it unless they ask. \n\t7. Keep track of the player’s score. If there are 10 tasks you want the player to complete, then the total score would be 10, and they would start at zero and score a point each time they complete a task. \n\t8. Let the player know when they have gained a point for having finished a task.\n\t9. Keep track of the rooms and how they connect to other rooms and in which directions. \n\t10.
